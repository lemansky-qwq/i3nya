Did something wrong and got the wrong result, at 1:00 a.m.

Pretend to be obedient

A new journey has begun

- evening

Suddenly eager to learn about a certain direction,

even to the point of collecting for it

I have to admit that after knowing that,

i couldn't let go anymore

Serious impact caused by incorrect results

- evening

Really need that direction at the beginning

Have a different perspective on life

Summoned the courage to speak

Attempt to spread to code 1

Mood is starting to feel strange
